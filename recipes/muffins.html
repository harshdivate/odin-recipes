        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Rise and shine! It's time for muffins. Our best muffin recipe ideas—like peanut butter-banana, blueberry cream, cinnamon doughnut and caramel apple—make sure there won't be any sleepyheads at breakfast.</p>
        <P>Fresh from the oven, these attractive, delicious muffins make a great accompaniment to any breakfast or brunch. I usually double the recipe because they seem to disappear the minute I set them out. —Marie Herr, Berea, Ohio</P>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
           <li>3 teaspoons baking powder </li>
           <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
           <li>¾ cup white sugar </li>
           <li>1 egg </li>
           <li>1 cup milk</li>
           <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
            <li>Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl; make a well in the center </li>
            <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in milk and oil. Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork until just moistened. The batter will be lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using; see variations below). Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
