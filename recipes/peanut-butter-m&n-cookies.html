      <h2>Description</h2> 
      <p>In 100% complete seriousness, I’d like to crown these cookies the most perfect cookie I’ve ever made. That’s high praise for an innocent little peanut butter cookie! They easily take the cake for tastiest, fluffiest, chewiest, and peanut buttery-est cookie I’ve ever had.</p>
      <p> he cookies are nothing like the traditional hard, crunchy peanut butter cookies you are used to. The exact opposite, in fact. They are so soft that they will literally melt in your mouth. A peanut butter cookie recipe GOLDMINE.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter </li>
        <li> ¾ cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li> ½ cup mini candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as mini M&M's®)</li>
      </ul> 
      <h3> Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Mix together peanut butter, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar, egg, baking soda, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg until combined. Mix in mini chocolate M&Ms. </li>
        <li>Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of dough and place 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Flatten dough balls to about 1/2 inch thickness. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cookies begin to slightly crack, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool 10 minutes on baking sheets before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
